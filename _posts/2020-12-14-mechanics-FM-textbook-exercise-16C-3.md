## 0. 改编题

本题改编自 Cambridge Internation AS & A Level Further Mathematics: Further Mechanics (剑桥 A Level 高数力学) 16C 课后习题第 3 题。

A Particle, P, of mass 3 kg is attached to one end of light, elastic spring. The other end of the spring is attached to a ceiling at the point A. The spring has natural length 1.6m and modulus of elasticity 45 N. The system rests in equilibrium with the spring vertical.

(a). Find the extension in the spring.
(b). The particle is pulled down a further 0.6 m and released. Find the distance of the particle below the point A when it first comes to instantanrous rest.
