The diagram shows two particles, $P$ and $Q$, connected by a light inextensible string which passes over a smooth block fixed to a horizontal table. The cross-section of the block is a quarter circle with centre $O$, which is at the edge of the table, and radius $a$. The angle between $OP$ and the table is $\theta$. The masses of $P$ and $Q$ are $m$ and $M$, respectively, where $m \lt M$.
Initially, $P$ is held at rest on the table and in contact with the block, $Q$ is vertically above $O$, and the string is taut. Then $P$ is released. Given that, in the subsequent motion, P remains in contact with the block as θ increases from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, find an expression, in terms of $m$, $M$, $\theta$ and $g$, for the normal reaction of the block on $P$ and show that

$$
\frac{m}{M} \geqslant \frac{\pi-1}{3}
$$
